<p> Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.

    Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking since his college days. Alton's original recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. What is posted here will easily serve eight people.</p>
    <h1>The Secret Behind This Classic Lasagna Recipe</h1>
    <p>From what I can tell, the secret behind Alton's lasagna is the addition of a little sugar to the sauce and using a bit more cheese than most other recipes.

        There are a few minor tweaks to his original recipe that I found necessary, for example adding a dash of wine vinegar to the sauce and changing the amount of Parmesan cheese.</p>
        <div><h1><b>Ingredients</b></h>
           <div class="indgredients"><P><pre>For the meat sauce:

             2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
             1 pound ground beef chuck
             1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)
             1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)
              2 cloves garlic, minced
              1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce
              3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)
              1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
              2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano
              1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed
              1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
              1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt
              1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar
              1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)
              Salt
                To assemble the lasagna:
                
             1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)
             15 ounces ricotta cheese
              1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced
              1/4 pound (4 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese</pre></P>

                    <P>This enduringly popular dish is a type of savoury pudding that combines meat with oatmeal, onions, salt and spices. Often served with the classic sides of bashed neeps and mashed tatties (that's Scots for turnip and potatoes), haggis is traditionally cooked in a sheep's stomach (a historic way of preserving meat), but most haggis nowadays is sold and cooked in a synthetic sausage casing. We agree that it may not win the title of the most elegant dish on the planet, but it really is undeniably delicious! Need more convincing?

                        As strange as haggis may sound, the end result is a culinary masterpiece. Meaty, oaty, fiery and moist, haggis makes a scrumptious meal. Largely made from oatmeal, it gives haggis its soft, crumbly texture - similar to stuffing - and earthy flavour, and, when combined with salt and spices, it has a spicy, rustic hint with a peppery kick! Now, that certainly sounds delicious, doesn't it?!
